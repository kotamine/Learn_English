1
00:00:37,364 --> 00:00:41,240
Hey, let's go
Hey, let's go 

2
00:00:41,396 --> 00:00:44,732
 I'm happy as can be 

3
00:00:45,131 --> 00:00:48,413
 Let's go walkin', you and me 

4
00:00:48,482 --> 00:00:49,514
 Ready, set 

5
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:52,374
 Come on, let's go 

6
00:00:53,351 --> 00:00:55,187
 Over the hill 

7
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:56,955
 Across the field 

8
00:00:57,023 --> 00:01:00,406
 Through the tunnel we'll go 

9
00:01:00,904 --> 00:01:04,529
 We'll run across the bridge 

10
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:08,900
 And down the bumpy gravel road 

11
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:12,604
 Right beneath the spider's web 

12
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:13,972
 Ready, set 

13
00:01:14,227 --> 00:01:15,173
 Let's 

14
00:01:15,368 --> 00:01:17,342
 Go 

15
00:01:25,332 --> 00:01:29,621
 Hey, let's go
Hey, let's go 

16
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:33,125
 I'm happy as can be 

17
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:36,495
 Let's go walkin', you and me 

18
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:37,729
 Ready, set 

19
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:40,385
 Come on, let's go 

20
00:01:40,994 --> 00:01:42,934
 The foxes and 

21
00:01:43,003 --> 00:01:45,170
 The badgers, too 

22
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:48,706
 All come out to play 

23
00:01:48,974 --> 00:01:52,344
 They all want to explore 

24
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:56,781
 The deep and wonderful woods
all day 

25
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:00,452
 Look at all my many friends 

26
00:02:00,502 --> 00:02:01,919
 Ready, set 

27
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:02,954
 Let's 

28
00:02:03,198 --> 00:02:05,056
 Go 

29
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:08,593
 Look at all my many friends 

30
00:02:08,764 --> 00:02:10,028
 Ready, set 

31
00:02:10,096 --> 00:02:11,095
 Let's 

32
00:02:11,165 --> 00:02:15,381
 Go 

33
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:35,453
Thanks.

34
00:02:38,227 --> 00:02:40,032
Daddy, you want any caramel candy?

35
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,894
Oh, thank you very much, I would.
Anybody tired yet?

36
00:02:43,076 --> 00:02:43,756
Mm-mmm.

37
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:44,855
We're almost there.

38
00:02:45,589 --> 00:02:45,980
Good.

39
00:02:56,815 --> 00:02:57,964
Mei, hide.

40
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,701
I thought he was a policeman.

41
00:03:05,726 --> 00:03:07,385
Hi!

42
00:03:08,014 --> 00:03:09,935
Hi!
Hello there!

43
00:03:38,122 --> 00:03:40,622
Sorry to bother you,
but are your parents around anywhere?

44
00:03:41,302 --> 00:03:43,074
They're out there, in the field.

45
00:03:43,294 --> 00:03:44,110
Thanks a lot.

46
00:03:46,521 --> 00:03:48,297
Hello there!

47
00:03:48,521 --> 00:03:51,117
Looks like we're
going to be neighbors!

48
00:03:52,383 --> 00:03:55,357
Pleasure to meet you.
Good luck in the new house!

49
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:58,104
- Oh!
- Thank you! See you soon!

50
00:04:00,428 --> 00:04:01,706
Thank you very much.

51
00:04:24,378 --> 00:04:25,285
Everybody out.

52
00:04:26,957 --> 00:04:27,800
Hey!

53
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:28,818
Hang on.

54
00:04:29,488 --> 00:04:30,355
There.

55
00:04:30,881 --> 00:04:32,516
Hey, Mei, come over here a minute.

56
00:04:32,638 --> 00:04:33,852
Wow!

57
00:04:35,431 --> 00:04:37,602
What are those little things
swimming around?

58
00:04:38,634 --> 00:04:41,016
I don't know.
Goldfish maybe or something?

59
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:43,610
So do you like it?

60
00:04:46,473 --> 00:04:48,264
- It's terrific!
- Uh-huh.

61
00:04:48,545 --> 00:04:49,943
Come on, Mei, run!

62
00:04:50,201 --> 00:04:51,092
Wait up!

63
00:04:53,305 --> 00:04:54,811
- Can we?
- Mm-hmm.

64
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:56,131
Oh!  Ha ha!

65
00:04:57,763 --> 00:04:59,154
You be careful, okay?

66
00:04:59,296 --> 00:05:00,365
Oh, sure.

67
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,724
What a lot of neat old junk.

68
00:05:10,432 --> 00:05:12,234
Do you think it's haunted?

69
00:05:14,256 --> 00:05:17,318
- Maybe it is.
- Oh, boy!

70
00:05:17,343 --> 00:05:19,107
Come on, I bet I can beat you
around the house!

71
00:05:19,132 --> 00:05:19,998
Hey, wait a minute!

72
00:05:27,171 --> 00:05:28,389
It's completely rotten.

73
00:05:28,743 --> 00:05:30,912
Uh-oh, it's gonna fall down!

74
00:05:47,593 --> 00:05:48,526
Hey!

75
00:05:53,855 --> 00:05:55,988
Wow, Mei, look up!

76
00:05:56,448 --> 00:05:57,236
What?

77
00:05:57,722 --> 00:05:59,197
Up there!  Look!

78
00:06:02,849 --> 00:06:05,224
Wow, what a tree!

79
00:06:05,637 --> 00:06:08,038
It's giant!

80
00:06:08,388 --> 00:06:10,553
- That's got to be the biggest tree in--
- Ah-choo!

81
00:06:15,537 --> 00:06:17,624
Daddy, look at that
big tree on the mountain!

82
00:06:18,332 --> 00:06:19,997
That's a camphor tree.

83
00:06:20,186 --> 00:06:21,318
Camphor.

84
00:06:22,821 --> 00:06:23,749
Camphor tree!

85
00:06:23,774 --> 00:06:25,985
- Camphor!
- Camphor tree!

86
00:06:33,545 --> 00:06:34,763
Uhh! Oh!

87
00:06:37,811 --> 00:06:38,638
Hey, Mei...

88
00:06:38,864 --> 00:06:40,388
Look, an acorn.

89
00:06:41,498 --> 00:06:43,216
But I want an acorn, too.

90
00:06:43,241 --> 00:06:44,826
Oh, hey, wait a second.

91
00:06:46,119 --> 00:06:47,435
There's some more over there.

92
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,286
Ah!  I have my own acorn right here.

93
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:54,014
Huh?

94
00:06:58,425 --> 00:07:01,095
Mei, how am I supposed to open
the house up if you're in the way?

95
00:07:01,172 --> 00:07:02,596
- Acorns!
- We found them!

96
00:07:02,621 --> 00:07:05,348
And I found a bunch of them right near the back door.

97
00:07:05,539 --> 00:07:06,848
And they came from way up!

98
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:09,550
It's true, they came out of the ceiling.

99
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,587
Hmm. Some squirrels
must have dropped them.

100
00:07:14,671 --> 00:07:16,103
Ohh! Squirrels!

101
00:07:17,018 --> 00:07:19,403
Or maybe some other animal,
perhaps a rat.

102
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,992
- Rats?
- But I don't want a dumb rat!

103
00:07:22,545 --> 00:07:24,317
Hey, uh, where am I going to put it?

104
00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:27,299
Um, just bring it here.
I'll open it up for you.

105
00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:29,190
Satsuki, go and open the kitchen door.

106
00:07:29,214 --> 00:07:30,373
- Uh huh.
- Hi!

107
00:07:30,414 --> 00:07:31,379
Here you go.

108
00:07:31,404 --> 00:07:32,681
- Mei, come on.
- That man's funny.

109
00:07:35,495 --> 00:07:36,208
Wait!

110
00:07:36,738 --> 00:07:38,026
Hey, wait up!

111
00:07:40,362 --> 00:07:42,183
 You can't catch me 

112
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:43,573
Can, too.

113
00:08:03,798 --> 00:08:05,169
- Uhh.
- Ohh.

114
00:08:11,222 --> 00:08:14,707
Aah!

115
00:08:18,453 --> 00:08:19,012
Hmm.

116
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:20,399
Ready?

117
00:08:20,798 --> 00:08:21,421
Mm-hmm.

118
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:34,562
- Bathtubs.
- Great.

119
00:08:40,422 --> 00:08:42,328
- Nothing up there.
- No.

120
00:08:43,871 --> 00:08:45,129
Bathtubs are in there.

121
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:47,097
We saw something move in there.

122
00:08:47,221 --> 00:08:47,972
A squirrel?

123
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,120
We're not sure.

124
00:08:49,489 --> 00:08:53,455
Well, maybe they were cockroaches,
but, anyway, there were millions of them.

125
00:08:54,884 --> 00:08:56,889
Lots o' little black things.

126
00:09:06,948 --> 00:09:07,924
See anything?

127
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:10,874
Well, I'm pretty sure
they were dust bunnies.

128
00:09:10,926 --> 00:09:13,626
You mean real dust bunnies,
like in my picture book?

129
00:09:13,724 --> 00:09:16,157
Dust bunnies make much
more sense than ghosts.

130
00:09:16,298 --> 00:09:17,330
Why?

131
00:09:20,341 --> 00:09:22,291
Well, ghosts are a lot harder to see.

132
00:09:22,316 --> 00:09:25,706
But when you suddenly move from a lighted room
to a dark one, you can't see for a second.

133
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,863
And that's when the dust bunnies come out.
Got it?

134
00:09:28,282 --> 00:09:29,697
Boy. Yeah.

135
00:09:30,189 --> 00:09:31,761
Come out! Come out!

136
00:09:31,786 --> 00:09:34,366
Come out!
‭Come on out!

137
00:09:37,203 --> 00:09:38,769
Come out, dust bunnies!

138
00:09:42,135 --> 00:09:43,568
Whadda ya say we get to work now?

139
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:47,227
We have to figure out where the steps are
that lead up to the attic, right?

140
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:47,885
What?

141
00:09:48,516 --> 00:09:52,424
So you go find the way up, and
we'll open all the windows upstairs.

142
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,465
- Yeah!
- Hey, wait for me.

143
00:10:03,017 --> 00:10:03,883
No stairs.

144
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:07,605
No.

145
00:10:10,995 --> 00:10:11,802
Nothing here.

146
00:10:12,024 --> 00:10:12,864
Nothing here.

147
00:10:16,323 --> 00:10:17,452
Nope. Nothing there.

148
00:10:18,133 --> 00:10:19,149
Nothing there.

149
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,688
Nobody in this room.

150
00:10:24,822 --> 00:10:25,995
Nobody here!

151
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:28,335
‭Hi!

152
00:10:28,985 --> 00:10:29,984
Hey!

153
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:40,005
Come here, Mei!
I found it!

154
00:10:43,599 --> 00:10:44,508
Wow.

155
00:10:47,092 --> 00:10:48,309
Someone up there?

156
00:10:48,796 --> 00:10:50,579
Catch some ghostses upstairs?

157
00:10:54,746 --> 00:10:55,816
It's an acorn.

158
00:10:58,901 --> 00:11:00,045
They must like 'em.

159
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,991
Little dust bunnies,
go away right now!

160
00:11:32,997 --> 00:11:38,357
Aah!

161
00:11:49,274 --> 00:11:51,588
Don't be scared, Mei.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

162
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,205
There's nobody here.

163
00:11:59,997 --> 00:12:00,513
Ah!

164
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:13,571
There.

165
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:16,890
That's it... easy.

166
00:12:17,661 --> 00:12:18,247
Slowly.

167
00:12:19,128 --> 00:12:20,151
Guess what?!

168
00:12:20,581 --> 00:12:22,800
Something's really
living upstairs after all!

169
00:12:22,861 --> 00:12:24,725
That's wonderful.
Good for you.

170
00:12:25,058 --> 00:12:27,205
I've always wanted to
have a haunted house.

171
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:28,850
It's been my lifelong dream.

172
00:12:30,225 --> 00:12:30,990
Careful!

173
00:13:19,252 --> 00:13:21,405
Guess what, sis!
I got one!

174
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:29,825
Ow!

175
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:33,829
Eh?

176
00:13:33,971 --> 00:13:34,438
Aah!

177
00:13:36,651 --> 00:13:37,175
Mei?

178
00:13:40,057 --> 00:13:41,546
- Ohh.
- Aah!

179
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:48,196
A couple of fine kids.

180
00:13:48,221 --> 00:13:50,220
Mei, there's nothing
to be frightened about.

181
00:13:50,245 --> 00:13:52,365
Nanny is the lady who
has the farm next door.

182
00:13:52,421 --> 00:13:53,787
She came over to help us out.

183
00:13:54,028 --> 00:13:57,264
Nanny, this is Mei, my sister,
and I'm Satsuki.

184
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:59,794
Very pleased to meet both of you.

185
00:14:00,114 --> 00:14:02,274
My, my, what smart children.

186
00:14:02,403 --> 00:14:06,563
If I had known what a big hurry you were in
to move, I would've cleaned the house up a bit.

187
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:11,320
Nanny, you've done so much already.
It really isn't necessary.

188
00:14:11,345 --> 00:14:16,074
Well, you know how it is. I've been
so busy in the rice paddies lately...

189
00:14:16,099 --> 00:14:18,936
Oh my gosh, how did you get all
that black on you?

190
00:14:18,982 --> 00:14:21,164
I had a dust bunny
right in my hand.

191
00:14:21,189 --> 00:14:22,697
Oh! Mei, your feet!

192
00:14:24,023 --> 00:14:24,593
Uh-oh.

193
00:14:24,618 --> 00:14:27,054
...once in a while, to do a little dusting,
you know...

194
00:14:28,346 --> 00:14:30,727
- You got mine black, too!
- Eh?

195
00:14:36,529 --> 00:14:37,372
Aha!

196
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:40,934
It appears the soot sprites
are hard at work.

197
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:41,791
What are they?

198
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:44,004
You mean those black
little fuzzy things

199
00:14:44,239 --> 00:14:46,746
that fly around the house
and disappear upstairs?

200
00:14:48,467 --> 00:14:51,910
Yes. They breed in very old empty houses...

201
00:14:51,935 --> 00:14:55,622
...building invisible nests,
and turning everything into dust.

202
00:14:56,417 --> 00:14:59,646
I could see them, too,
when I was a very small child.

203
00:15:00,074 --> 00:15:03,694
That you two are able to see them
makes me very glad.

204
00:15:03,813 --> 00:15:05,430
It couldn't have been
a spirit, could it?

205
00:15:06,316 --> 00:15:09,346
If they're not sprites, then you
have nothing to be frightened about.

206
00:15:10,257 --> 00:15:15,667
If we all keep smiling, the sprites may
gradually go away and leave this place alone.

207
00:15:16,265 --> 00:15:19,179
Yes. I'm sure that
somewhere up in that ceiling...

208
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:22,660
...they're busily discussing plans
for leaving the house.

209
00:15:27,122 --> 00:15:29,058
Maybe they really will leave us alone.

210
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:30,294
Well, what's wrong with them?

211
00:15:30,473 --> 00:15:33,072
With dust bunnies all over the house,
you wouldn't want to go away!

212
00:15:33,097 --> 00:15:34,898
I'm not afraid of dust bunnies.

213
00:15:35,326 --> 00:15:38,451
Well, maybe you can go to the bathroom
by yourself at night.

214
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,712
Ha ha ha!

215
00:15:40,878 --> 00:15:42,919
Come, come! The house needs cleaning up.

216
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,801
So fetch a bucket and go get
some water.

217
00:15:45,965 --> 00:15:48,358
- You mean from the stream?
- Maybe we'll catch a fish!

218
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,218
You wait here, okay?

219
00:16:03,218 --> 00:16:04,519
Did you get any fish?

220
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:17,951
It's coming out!

221
00:16:18,045 --> 00:16:20,915
- It's coming out, Nanny!
- Good. Very good.

222
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,003
Just keep at it till the water
gets cold.

223
00:16:24,112 --> 00:16:24,745
Right.

224
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:09,019
Hey, is that for us?

225
00:17:09,147 --> 00:17:11,388
Is that for me?
Tell me what your name is.

226
00:17:12,788 --> 00:17:14,188
Uh, it's for grandma.

227
00:17:14,673 --> 00:17:15,173
Huh?

228
00:17:16,106 --> 00:17:17,063
Grandma?

229
00:17:18,715 --> 00:17:19,438
Yuh-uh-uh.

230
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:21,564
Hmm?

231
00:17:21,869 --> 00:17:22,307
Mmm!

232
00:17:23,453 --> 00:17:25,492
- Yuh!
- Hey, wait up! Where you going?

233
00:17:26,262 --> 00:17:27,748
Kanta, don't be silly.

234
00:17:30,021 --> 00:17:32,364
Hey, haven't you heard?

235
00:17:32,589 --> 00:17:35,268
You're living in a haunted house!

236
00:17:35,749 --> 00:17:36,754
Go away!

237
00:17:36,915 --> 00:17:37,354
Yuh!

238
00:17:44,801 --> 00:17:46,049
Ha ha ha!

239
00:17:46,171 --> 00:17:49,607
Well, I remember doing the very same thing
when I was his age.

240
00:17:50,074 --> 00:17:51,166
I hate boys...

241
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,928
...but I love Nanny's food better than
anything else in the whole wide world!

242
00:17:55,766 --> 00:17:57,193
Eat all you want.

243
00:17:58,456 --> 00:17:59,443
Thanks for your help!

244
00:17:59,721 --> 00:18:00,721
Bye!

245
00:18:02,986 --> 00:18:04,319
Thank you so much, Nanny.

246
00:18:06,097 --> 00:18:07,432
- Goodbye!
- Bye-bye!

247
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:25,612
Daddy, I'm scared the wind's going to
make the house fall down.

248
00:19:27,847 --> 00:19:30,560
Maybe it will, but I hope not
because we just moved in.

249
00:19:53,891 --> 00:19:54,157
Ah!

250
00:20:01,923 --> 00:20:05,089
Ha! ‭Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!

251
00:20:05,355 --> 00:20:08,998
Hey, come on. What are you waiting for?
You have to laugh loud to scare a spirit.

252
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,545
Ha ha ha!
Hee hee hee!

253
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:13,019
I'm not scared at all.

254
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:14,566
Haa! Ha ha ha!

255
00:20:14,591 --> 00:20:16,571
Hey, I'm not! I mean it!

256
00:20:19,487 --> 00:20:21,733
Hah-haa! Ha ha ha!

257
00:21:00,563 --> 00:21:01,349
One, two.

258
00:21:01,574 --> 00:21:02,373
One, two.

259
00:21:02,574 --> 00:21:03,275
One, two.

260
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,098
- That's it.  Give it all you got.
- One, two. One, two.

261
00:21:05,435 --> 00:21:07,445
- Come on, yeah.
- One, two. One, two.

262
00:21:08,423 --> 00:21:09,314
There we go.

263
00:21:12,088 --> 00:21:14,876
Well, if I may humbly say so,
we're finished.

264
00:21:15,021 --> 00:21:17,064
Yay!

265
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:26,082
- There we are.
- Get ready to fly, Mei!

266
00:21:27,793 --> 00:21:29,072
Better hold on!

267
00:21:31,031 --> 00:21:33,261
Here we go!

268
00:21:43,687 --> 00:21:45,657
Nanny!

269
00:21:47,024 --> 00:21:48,505
Hi!

270
00:21:48,907 --> 00:21:50,410
Hello!

271
00:21:50,947 --> 00:21:53,291
Where are you pedaling
off to this morning?

272
00:21:53,676 --> 00:21:56,501
We're going to visit mommy
in the hospital!

273
00:21:56,779 --> 00:21:59,290
Well, be sure
to give my regards!

274
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:03,317
- I know she'll be very happy to see you!
- Bye-bye.

275
00:22:19,944 --> 00:22:21,815
That way, daddy!
That way!

276
00:22:49,721 --> 00:22:50,584
- Good afternoon.
- ‭Oh!

277
00:22:52,888 --> 00:22:55,983
- Mommy!
- My love, I'm so happy to see you.

278
00:22:56,008 --> 00:22:58,777
Daddy took the wrong road,
and we had to come back another way.

279
00:22:58,802 --> 00:23:01,499
Well! Don't be shy.

280
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,316
We got off today from school.

281
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:04,642
Wonderful.

282
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:07,479
Mommy, um, daddy told me
tell you he'll be here.

283
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:09,774
He's probably speaking to the doctor, Mei.

284
00:23:09,887 --> 00:23:11,853
It's so good to be able to see you all.

285
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,600
Please tell me about the new house.
Do you like it?

286
00:23:14,817 --> 00:23:15,319
Yeah.

287
00:23:18,141 --> 00:23:20,927
- Oh! You mean they live upstairs?
- Mm-hmm.

288
00:23:21,147 --> 00:23:23,418
Do you like spirits, mommy?  Even fuzzy ones?

289
00:23:23,609 --> 00:23:26,951
Of course. I wish I could go home with you
and see them right away.

290
00:23:27,064 --> 00:23:28,136
You were right, Mei.

291
00:23:28,292 --> 00:23:29,251
Mm-hmm.

292
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,914
We thought you might not be too happy
about the house being filled with spooks.

293
00:23:33,146 --> 00:23:34,304
Are you happy with them?

294
00:23:34,744 --> 00:23:37,143
- Yep.
- And I'm not afraid of them at all.

295
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:41,945
Don't tell me you fixed Mei's ponytails
by yourself.

296
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:42,718
Mm-hmm.

297
00:23:43,391 --> 00:23:44,478
They're beautiful.

298
00:23:45,053 --> 00:23:47,186
You know, you're a very lucky girl.

299
00:23:47,435 --> 00:23:49,401
She gets mad at me almost all the time!

300
00:23:49,539 --> 00:23:52,912
- And that's because you're always jumping around.
- Satsuki, come here.

301
00:23:53,751 --> 00:23:55,627
Why don't you let me
brush your hair for a minute?

302
00:23:55,758 --> 00:23:57,299
I'm glad you let me keep it short.

303
00:23:57,476 --> 00:23:59,064
I want mine short too!

304
00:23:59,134 --> 00:24:00,523
Only when you're my age, Mei!

305
00:24:00,651 --> 00:24:05,564
Satsuki, you have wire for hair, as stubborn
as mine was when I was small girl.

306
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:09,350
I'll be able to have hair as beautiful
as yours when I become older, won't I?

307
00:24:10,169 --> 00:24:14,873
Of course you will! And I know that because
you're the spitting image of me when I was young.

308
00:24:18,414 --> 00:24:18,914
Hi.

309
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:33,439
I thought mommy looked a lot better.

310
00:24:33,619 --> 00:24:37,524
A lot better! In fact, I think the doctor
might let her leave in a very short time!

311
00:24:37,981 --> 00:24:39,732
Does a short time mean tomorrow, daddy?

312
00:24:40,174 --> 00:24:42,023
Aw, come on! Tomorrow means tomorrow.

313
00:24:42,289 --> 00:24:44,263
Maybe not tomorrow, but it's pretty soon.

314
00:24:44,464 --> 00:24:47,858
She said when she comes home,
she's only gonna sleep in my own bed.

315
00:24:48,073 --> 00:24:51,790
Hey, what about what you told me: that you were big enough to sleep all by yourself.

316
00:24:52,124 --> 00:24:53,758
Mommy told me it be okay.

317
00:25:15,751 --> 00:25:16,528
Daddy!

318
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:19,033
Daddy, wake up!
It's morning!

319
00:25:21,551 --> 00:25:22,306
Daddy, get up!

320
00:25:23,451 --> 00:25:25,384
It's Mei!

321
00:25:30,165 --> 00:25:32,374
- Good morning.
- I must have overslept or something.

322
00:25:32,737 --> 00:25:34,486
We get our lunch boxes today.

323
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,140
I'm sorry. I completely forgot.

324
00:25:37,367 --> 00:25:39,557
I made lunch for everybody!
Don't worry about it.

325
00:25:39,865 --> 00:25:41,021
Hey, it's burning!

326
00:25:41,046 --> 00:25:41,794
Just a minute!

327
00:25:44,862 --> 00:25:46,310
Okay, this one's for you.

328
00:25:47,787 --> 00:25:48,852
That one's mine.

329
00:25:49,742 --> 00:25:51,629
Mei, stop that. Sit down and eat.

330
00:25:51,903 --> 00:25:53,206
Go ahead. Wrap it yourself.

331
00:25:58,808 --> 00:26:01,570
Hey! You're late!

332
00:26:01,749 --> 00:26:02,858
- Satsuki!
- Must be time to go.

333
00:26:02,883 --> 00:26:06,144
'Kay!

334
00:26:07,169 --> 00:26:09,141
I can't believe you've made a friend already.

335
00:26:09,455 --> 00:26:11,636
Hey, bet you sit next to her in class.

336
00:26:11,769 --> 00:26:13,128
Yep, and her name's Michiko.

337
00:26:19,366 --> 00:26:20,312
Here I come!

338
00:26:20,637 --> 00:26:22,516
Well, thanks for saying goodbye!

339
00:26:23,405 --> 00:26:24,520
Hi. Sorry.

340
00:26:24,997 --> 00:26:27,000
How come you took so long? We're going to be late!

341
00:26:39,933 --> 00:26:41,214
Daddy, this hat!

342
00:26:42,238 --> 00:26:43,893
Am I a grownup if I wear it?

343
00:26:44,033 --> 00:26:46,189
It looks that way to me.
Where are you off to?

344
00:26:46,326 --> 00:26:47,599
Gonna get some flowers.

345
00:27:10,878 --> 00:27:12,629
Is it lunchtime yet?

346
00:27:12,957 --> 00:27:14,253
I don't think so!

347
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,220
Daddy, look. I'm the flower lady.

348
00:27:46,108 --> 00:27:47,053
Gollywollypogs!

349
00:27:54,407 --> 00:27:55,799
Hmm.

350
00:28:07,505 --> 00:28:08,993
There's no bottom.

351
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:10,051
Huh?

352
00:28:18,825 --> 00:28:21,648
Wow! Acorn!

353
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:23,306
Dust bunnies.

354
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,235
Hey.

355
00:29:14,652 --> 00:29:15,105
Huh?

356
00:29:31,083 --> 00:29:32,265
Come back!

357
00:29:51,685 --> 00:29:52,557
Aha!

358
00:30:33,057 --> 00:30:33,927
Hm?

359
00:32:50,377 --> 00:32:51,236
Hey.

360
00:33:53,588 --> 00:33:54,787
Mmm.

361
00:33:59,824 --> 00:34:03,009
Tell me who you are.
Are you a big dust bunny?

362
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:29,833
Totoro?

363
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:34,176
That's it. I bet your name's Totoro, isn't it?

364
00:34:39,146 --> 00:34:40,875
So you're really a Totoro.

365
00:34:44,174 --> 00:34:44,930
Totoro.

366
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:54,449
Sure, I will. Tomorrow.

367
00:35:54,595 --> 00:35:55,527
- Okay, bye!
- See you later!

368
00:35:57,044 --> 00:35:58,497
Daddy, I'm home.

369
00:35:58,654 --> 00:36:01,460
Already? Wait a minute.
How come you're home so late?

370
00:36:01,625 --> 00:36:03,584
I was playing with Michiko.
Where's Mei?

371
00:36:03,724 --> 00:36:06,605
That's funny, I haven't even eaten my lunch...
I think Mei's out back.

372
00:36:07,547 --> 00:36:08,519
Mei!

373
00:36:09,035 --> 00:36:10,854
Mei!

374
00:36:12,356 --> 00:36:13,016
Mei?

375
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:17,576
Mei?

376
00:36:24,158 --> 00:36:25,581
Daddy, over here!

377
00:36:25,818 --> 00:36:27,549
I think I know where Mei went.

378
00:36:40,533 --> 00:36:41,099
Mei?

379
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,372
Mei!

380
00:36:43,077 --> 00:36:43,793
Wake up!

381
00:36:44,211 --> 00:36:44,746
Wake up.

382
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,879
Wake up, Mei! Right now!

383
00:36:56,089 --> 00:36:58,180
You have no business sleeping
in this place.

384
00:37:00,366 --> 00:37:01,495
How come he's gone?

385
00:37:01,704 --> 00:37:02,745
How come who's gone?

386
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,028
Tell me who you lost.

387
00:37:09,714 --> 00:37:11,708
A big Totoro was here with me.

388
00:37:11,849 --> 00:37:14,671
You don't mean a big one, like what's in
our picture books, do you?

389
00:37:15,019 --> 00:37:15,699
Mm-hmm.

390
00:37:16,005 --> 00:37:17,605
And I climbed up on top of him,

391
00:37:18,195 --> 00:37:19,214
and he was furry,

392
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:21,494
and he had a big mouth,

393
00:37:21,993 --> 00:37:22,992
and there was a little one,

394
00:37:23,927 --> 00:37:24,958
and one this big,

395
00:37:25,685 --> 00:37:28,875
and a great big one sleeping by himself.

396
00:37:29,271 --> 00:37:30,210
Uh-huh?

397
00:37:30,376 --> 00:37:33,640
Hello! Is anybody in there?

398
00:37:35,041 --> 00:37:37,885
Well, I'll be.
What a great hiding place.

399
00:37:38,245 --> 00:37:41,388
Daddy! Mei was just telling
me she saw a big Totoro.

400
00:37:41,782 --> 00:37:43,244
- A real one?
- Mm-hmm.

401
00:37:44,087 --> 00:37:44,761
This way.

402
00:37:53,291 --> 00:37:54,894
Hey, give me a chance.

403
00:38:00,266 --> 00:38:00,980
Here?

404
00:38:01,604 --> 00:38:02,706
Mmm. Mm-hmm.

405
00:38:03,048 --> 00:38:05,282
He was by the big tree a little while ago.

406
00:38:05,496 --> 00:38:07,250
I don't see how he could've gotten away.

407
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:11,046
Mei! Mei, come back!

408
00:38:26,066 --> 00:38:27,089
Stop laughing!

409
00:38:27,262 --> 00:38:29,223
I really saw him, I'm not lying.

410
00:38:30,394 --> 00:38:31,590
I'm not lying.

411
00:38:40,462 --> 00:38:41,239
Mei.

412
00:38:42,366 --> 00:38:43,591
You don't believe me.

413
00:38:44,241 --> 00:38:45,126
Mm-hmm.

414
00:38:45,744 --> 00:38:49,170
That's where you're wrong.
I believe you're being completely truthful about this.

415
00:38:49,875 --> 00:38:52,707
But I also believe that you met
the king of the forest, Mei.

416
00:38:53,322 --> 00:38:55,404
And meeting him is a sign of good luck.

417
00:38:56,123 --> 00:38:58,316
But there's no guarantee that
you'll see him all the time.

418
00:38:58,863 --> 00:38:59,293
Come on.

419
00:39:01,081 --> 00:39:03,817
- We'll have to go back and pay our respects.
- Where do we find him?

420
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,295
- Well, Miss Mei will find him for us.
- Yeah!

421
00:39:20,831 --> 00:39:21,678
Oh!

422
00:39:22,516 --> 00:39:25,059
Oh, Mei, you're getting heavier
by the minute.

423
00:39:25,083 --> 00:39:26,923
Daddy, the camphor tree.

424
00:39:27,972 --> 00:39:29,750
What a beautiful tree.

425
00:39:37,739 --> 00:39:38,768
I found it.

426
00:39:39,903 --> 00:39:41,544
- You sure that's the one?
- Uh-huh.

427
00:39:42,251 --> 00:39:44,004
What are you waiting
for, daddy? Hurry up!

428
00:39:51,933 --> 00:39:53,732
The hole's not there anymore...

429
00:39:55,287 --> 00:39:57,186
...but I'm sure this is where it was.

430
00:39:57,357 --> 00:39:58,503
You're positive it is?

431
00:39:58,916 --> 00:39:59,625
Mm-hmm.

432
00:40:00,291 --> 00:40:02,045
The opening's completely disappeared.

433
00:40:02,362 --> 00:40:05,256
Well, remember, you can see him
only when he wants you to.

434
00:40:05,378 --> 00:40:06,526
- Will we see him?
- Maybe.

435
00:40:06,551 --> 00:40:07,572
But I want to meet him.

436
00:40:08,515 --> 00:40:10,777
You never can tell, if we're lucky enough.

437
00:40:12,664 --> 00:40:14,277
What a beautiful tree it is.

438
00:40:15,185 --> 00:40:18,612
This tree's been here, well,
since before anyone can remember.

439
00:40:19,436 --> 00:40:24,044
You know, a long time ago,
man and trees were the best of friends.

440
00:40:26,155 --> 00:40:30,338
It's actually because of this tree that
I decided to buy our house in the first place,

441
00:40:31,043 --> 00:40:33,182
and you can bet mommy will
like it when she sees it.

442
00:40:33,568 --> 00:40:36,744
So, whadda ya say we thank the king of the forest
and get back for our lunch.

443
00:40:37,129 --> 00:40:39,802
I have to meet Michiko after lunch
to get ready for an exam.

444
00:40:39,952 --> 00:40:41,030
I'm coming, too.

445
00:40:41,078 --> 00:40:42,409
Attention!

446
00:40:43,589 --> 00:40:47,853
Thank you for all you've done for Mei.
Please look after her and protect her forever.

447
00:40:48,274 --> 00:40:50,283
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you so much.

448
00:40:51,352 --> 00:40:54,264
- Last one home's a rotten egg.
- Hey, that's not fair! You cheated!

449
00:40:54,441 --> 00:40:55,623
Wait!

450
00:40:57,104 --> 00:40:58,185
Hey!

451
00:41:00,305 --> 00:41:01,947
Hey, wait up!

452
00:41:03,734 --> 00:41:04,576
<i>Dear Mother,</i>

453
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:09,470
<i>You're never going to believe this, but today,
under that giant tree on the top of the hill,</i>

454
00:41:09,998 --> 00:41:12,392
<i>Mei actually met a ghost: Totoro.</i>

455
00:41:13,133 --> 00:41:15,282
<i>Daddy says it was
the king of the forest.</i>

456
00:41:15,593 --> 00:41:19,103
<i>Well, whoever he was, I really want
to meet him.</i>

457
00:41:49,847 --> 00:41:52,979
Kanta, you'd better hurry up,
or you'll be late.

458
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:54,210
Okay!

459
00:42:27,156 --> 00:42:27,770
There.

460
00:42:31,423 --> 00:42:32,149
Huh?

461
00:42:36,994 --> 00:42:37,834
Mei? What...

462
00:42:38,673 --> 00:42:39,615
Excuse me.

463
00:42:40,253 --> 00:42:41,276
Yes, Satsuki?

464
00:42:41,779 --> 00:42:43,459
I-it's my sister Mei.

465
00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:45,993
Oh my gosh!

466
00:42:46,018 --> 00:42:47,554
- What's with the new girl?
- Who is she?

467
00:42:47,579 --> 00:42:49,926
What's she going to do?
Is she gonna bring her back here?

468
00:42:50,518 --> 00:42:52,233
Nanny! Nanny, what happened?

469
00:42:52,811 --> 00:42:57,383
Dear, I'm sorry, but she demanded
to be with her sister and simply won't listen.

470
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:58,660
But I'm going to be--

471
00:42:59,142 --> 00:43:01,531
Mei, now, you promised to be a good girl...

472
00:43:01,556 --> 00:43:05,734
...because daddy was gonna be at the university
and wasn't gonna be able to take care of you.

473
00:43:07,827 --> 00:43:10,064
I have a couple hours left before I can come home,

474
00:43:10,238 --> 00:43:12,303
and Nanny's been very nice to watch you.

475
00:43:13,021 --> 00:43:16,204
Our Mei has been a very good little girl, eh?

476
00:43:24,722 --> 00:43:27,726
Well, I better ask permission
for her to come inside.

477
00:43:33,675 --> 00:43:35,707
Because her mother's going to be in the hospital...

478
00:43:35,732 --> 00:43:38,893
...Satsuki will be taking care of her
sister Mei for a short while.

479
00:43:39,263 --> 00:43:40,388
Is that clear for everybody?

480
00:43:40,889 --> 00:43:42,316
Yes, ma'am.

481
00:43:47,736 --> 00:43:49,132
What's that a picture of, Mei?

482
00:43:49,402 --> 00:43:50,672
A Totoro picture.

483
00:43:51,184 --> 00:43:51,967
Shh!

484
00:43:52,656 --> 00:43:54,206
Could you be a little more quiet
about it?

485
00:44:05,771 --> 00:44:06,532
Bye-bye.

486
00:44:06,646 --> 00:44:07,936
Want to come over and play?

487
00:44:08,155 --> 00:44:11,048
If I can...
but I might miss the club meeting, is that okay?

488
00:44:11,142 --> 00:44:12,929
- Come whenever you can.  See ya!
- See ya!

489
00:44:12,954 --> 00:44:14,353
- Bye, Mei.
- Goodbye.

490
00:44:15,437 --> 00:44:17,376
We'd better walk fast,
or we're going to get wet.

491
00:44:17,594 --> 00:44:18,095
'Kay.

492
00:44:26,229 --> 00:44:27,682
Oh, no! Hurry!

493
00:44:37,687 --> 00:44:38,139
Oh, my god.

494
00:44:38,805 --> 00:44:39,693
Are you okay?

495
00:44:40,292 --> 00:44:41,410
- Yeah.
- Come on.

496
00:44:50,007 --> 00:44:51,840
Wow. What do we do now?

497
00:44:54,668 --> 00:44:57,593
If it's not too much trouble,
could we stay until it stops raining?

498
00:45:39,876 --> 00:45:40,524
Uh...

499
00:45:41,605 --> 00:45:42,383
Uh, thanks.

500
00:45:44,025 --> 00:45:44,639
Uh...

501
00:45:56,398 --> 00:45:57,420
Whoo! Whoo-hoo!

502
00:46:03,485 --> 00:46:05,220
We were pretty lucky, huh?

503
00:46:06,757 --> 00:46:09,588
Ha ha! That's funny.
It's got holes in it.

504
00:46:21,108 --> 00:46:22,694
Uh-oh. Daddy left his umbrella.

505
00:46:22,834 --> 00:46:24,478
Hey, we could bring it back to him!

506
00:46:27,896 --> 00:46:29,699
I just forgot because I forgot.

507
00:46:29,724 --> 00:46:32,262
How can you forget your umbrella
when it's raining outside?

508
00:46:32,287 --> 00:46:32,769
Ow!

509
00:46:32,794 --> 00:46:34,934
- Even you can't be that stupid.
- Mom!

510
00:46:35,195 --> 00:46:37,545
You were probably playing with it,
and broke it in half or something.

511
00:46:37,583 --> 00:46:38,588
I did not!

512
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:45,589
Hmm?

513
00:46:46,231 --> 00:46:47,893
Y-y-yii!

514
00:46:51,992 --> 00:46:53,599
Excuse me! Is anybody home?

515
00:46:55,946 --> 00:46:57,904
Satsuki, what are you doing here?

516
00:46:58,136 --> 00:46:59,019
Grandma.

517
00:47:00,988 --> 00:47:04,694
- Thank you for taking care of Mei.
- Oh, don't be ridiculous. She was a treasure.

518
00:47:04,837 --> 00:47:07,793
Well, besides that, we wanted to
bring back the umbrella we borrowed.

519
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,099
But--Kanta's umbrella?

520
00:47:10,124 --> 00:47:12,232
Why would he give you
this beat-up thing?

521
00:47:12,257 --> 00:47:14,283
It came in handy, because we didn't have one...

522
00:47:14,544 --> 00:47:16,278
...but I'm afraid he got soaking wet.

523
00:47:16,728 --> 00:47:18,491
Anyway, please thank him for us.

524
00:47:18,516 --> 00:47:23,326
I will. I'm always telling him to wash the mud off,
so some rain did him no harm at all.

525
00:47:24,127 --> 00:47:26,014
Are you on your way
to meet your father?

526
00:47:26,082 --> 00:47:26,808
Yes, ma'am.

527
00:47:26,846 --> 00:47:28,320
Well, you give him my regards.

528
00:47:28,655 --> 00:47:30,105
- Bye-bye.
- ‭Bye.

529
00:47:41,267 --> 00:47:42,910
Did someone come to the door?

530
00:47:42,979 --> 00:47:44,109
I didn't hear anything.

531
00:47:48,085 --> 00:47:49,641
Oh, boy, we made it!

532
00:47:59,154 --> 00:47:59,960
Thank you.

533
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:01,678
Thank you.

534
00:48:03,153 --> 00:48:04,472
Getting onboard or not?

535
00:48:07,109 --> 00:48:08,606
All right, let's go.

536
00:48:16,171 --> 00:48:17,960
Daddy wasn't on that one, right?

537
00:48:18,519 --> 00:48:20,167
I'm sure he'll be on the next one.

538
00:48:20,572 --> 00:48:22,574
Do you want to go back
to Nanny's house and wait?

539
00:48:58,637 --> 00:48:59,648
What's the matter?

540
00:49:31,949 --> 00:49:33,621
- Mei, you're sleepy.
- Uh-uh.

541
00:49:33,646 --> 00:49:37,300
Aw, come on now...
I told you it might be a while.

542
00:49:37,623 --> 00:49:39,291
You don't want to go
to Nanny's and wait?

543
00:49:42,018 --> 00:49:45,363
It won't be long, I'm sure the bus
will come soon. Just hang in there.

544
00:49:49,559 --> 00:49:52,070
Well, I guess they were delayed,
but I hope not.

545
00:50:00,187 --> 00:50:00,687
Come on.

546
00:51:25,194 --> 00:51:27,932
I bet... you're Totoro.

547
00:51:36,463 --> 00:51:38,735
Oh, we have another umbrella,
if you want.

548
00:51:43,587 --> 00:51:44,634
Go ahead, take it.

549
00:51:46,415 --> 00:51:48,500
Come on! I'm going to drop Mei.

550
00:51:54,716 --> 00:51:56,240
You put it over your head like that.

551
00:53:09,472 --> 00:53:09,955
Huh?

552
00:53:10,362 --> 00:53:10,766
Huh?

553
00:53:13,422 --> 00:53:14,380
The bus is here!

554
00:54:22,216 --> 00:54:25,478
Mei, wa-wasn't that umbrella
he took with him daddy's?

555
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:37,480
Thank you.

556
00:54:38,581 --> 00:54:39,925
How nice of you to meet me!

557
00:54:40,606 --> 00:54:41,922
Daddy!

558
00:54:42,068 --> 00:54:45,644
I'm sorry, but the train was late.
That's why I missed the first bus.

559
00:54:45,948 --> 00:54:47,785
You weren't worried about me, were you?

560
00:54:48,403 --> 00:54:50,780
I saw him! I saw him!
He was right beside me at the bus stop!

561
00:54:50,805 --> 00:54:52,482
Me, too!  We saw Catbus too!

562
00:54:52,702 --> 00:54:53,741
Uh... uh...

563
00:54:54,337 --> 00:54:57,211
- Oh, and gigantic arms.
- Great big eyeballs, too.

564
00:54:58,046 --> 00:55:00,291
- It was scary.
- I was scared.

565
00:55:02,363 --> 00:55:05,723
- We saw Totoro! We saw Totoro!
-  We saw Totoro! We saw Totoro! 

566
00:55:17,644 --> 00:55:19,060
Hey, anyone want a ride?

567
00:55:19,116 --> 00:55:21,473
- I do!
- Okay, here we go!

568
00:55:26,961 --> 00:55:27,781
<i>Dear mother,</i>

569
00:55:27,974 --> 00:55:32,382
<i>I'm surprised I can write to you at all,
'cause my heart is still beating so fast.</i>

570
00:55:32,804 --> 00:55:35,235
<i>Mei and I had something incredible
happen today.</i>

571
00:55:35,643 --> 00:55:37,074
<i>We both met Totoro!</i>

572
00:55:37,444 --> 00:55:38,724
<i>I really saw him!</i>

573
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:40,647
<i>He even gave us a gift.</i>

574
00:55:41,151 --> 00:55:44,906
<i>It was a package wrapped up in
bamboo leaves and tied with dragon whiskers.</i>

575
00:55:45,109 --> 00:55:47,708
<i>We opened it as soon as we got home,
and guess what was in it!</i>

576
00:55:48,024 --> 00:55:49,447
<i>Magic nuts and seeds.</i>

577
00:55:53,934 --> 00:55:58,868
We've decided to plant them all out in the front,
because someday they'll be tall and beautiful.

578
00:55:59,429 --> 00:56:00,154
Mei just...

579
00:56:00,179 --> 00:56:03,312
<i>...sits there every day,
waiting for them to sprout,</i>

580
00:56:03,509 --> 00:56:05,444
<i>but they don't seem
to want to grow.</i>

581
00:56:05,636 --> 00:56:07,554
<i>I can't wait to see
what they'll be like.</i>

582
00:56:08,087 --> 00:56:12,086
<i>Oh, yes, Mei sends her love and wanted
to make sure you saw her drawing.</i>

583
00:56:16,875 --> 00:56:19,595
<i>It's going to be summer vacation soon,
and we'll be out of school.</i>

584
00:56:20,083 --> 00:56:22,559
<i>I love you, mother.
And please get well soon.</i>

585
00:56:26,267 --> 00:56:27,458
Come on, get off.

586
00:56:27,537 --> 00:56:29,887
That's it! I said get off!

587
00:56:31,924 --> 00:56:33,303
Come on, it's bedtime.

588
00:56:33,786 --> 00:56:36,219
Daddy, will the plants come out?

589
00:56:36,222 --> 00:56:37,863
I mean will they come out tomorrow?

590
00:56:38,177 --> 00:56:39,276
That's tough to say.

591
00:56:39,452 --> 00:56:41,694
Perhaps Totoro will be able to say
if they will.

592
00:56:42,277 --> 00:56:43,007
Good night.

593
00:57:32,209 --> 00:57:33,494
Wake up, Mei.

594
00:57:51,614 --> 00:57:53,609
- But isn't that where we planted--
- Mm-hmm.

595
00:57:56,092 --> 00:57:56,738
Oh! Ow!

596
00:58:16,259 --> 00:58:17,394
It worked!

597
00:59:24,313 --> 00:59:25,669
Yay!

598
00:59:26,389 --> 00:59:28,517
We did it! Yay!

599
00:59:42,264 --> 00:59:43,774
Yay!

600
00:59:57,105 --> 00:59:58,214
Yah!

601
01:00:43,282 --> 01:00:46,002
- Aah!
- ‭Now we know what makes the wind blow!

602
01:01:11,894 --> 01:01:12,149
Hm.

603
01:01:15,921 --> 01:01:16,481
Huh?

604
01:01:47,128 --> 01:01:48,519
What happened to the tree?

605
01:01:49,505 --> 01:01:50,778
- Hey!
- No way!

606
01:01:54,173 --> 01:01:55,940
We did it! We did it!

607
01:01:56,281 --> 01:01:57,370
Yay!

608
01:01:58,949 --> 01:01:59,876
It was only a dream.

609
01:01:59,993 --> 01:02:01,123
It wasn't a dream.

610
01:02:01,479 --> 01:02:03,100
It was only a dream!

611
01:02:03,163 --> 01:02:04,527
It wasn't a dream!

612
01:02:04,603 --> 01:02:06,869
It was only a dream!

613
01:02:07,358 --> 01:02:08,805
We did it!

614
01:02:11,411 --> 01:02:12,416
We did it!

615
01:02:23,737 --> 01:02:24,753
Telegram!

616
01:02:25,613 --> 01:02:26,513
Hello!

617
01:02:27,842 --> 01:02:28,809
Telegram!

618
01:02:29,507 --> 01:02:31,631
Hello! Anyone home?

619
01:02:32,359 --> 01:02:32,880
Hmm.

620
01:02:33,676 --> 01:02:34,463
Maybe not.

621
01:02:42,417 --> 01:02:43,810
Nanny!

622
01:02:48,225 --> 01:02:49,429
Over here, Mei.

623
01:02:51,605 --> 01:02:53,082
That one's perfect.

624
01:02:59,845 --> 01:03:00,772
Ahh...!

625
01:03:02,929 --> 01:03:04,330
About how ripe is this?

626
01:03:04,517 --> 01:03:05,315
That's ripe.

627
01:03:09,721 --> 01:03:10,567
Wow.

628
01:03:12,031 --> 01:03:14,800
Your vegetable garden is more like
a mountain of treasure.

629
01:03:14,967 --> 01:03:16,432
Thanks to mother nature.

630
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,870
Let's take a little rest,
shall we?

631
01:03:25,374 --> 01:03:27,476
There we are, nice and cold.

632
01:03:27,691 --> 01:03:29,143
Michiko will be jealous.

633
01:03:32,421 --> 01:03:33,623
Mmm.

634
01:03:38,525 --> 01:03:39,725
It's amazing.

635
01:03:39,897 --> 01:03:42,672
They've absorbed lots of wonderful things
from the sun...

636
01:03:42,697 --> 01:03:46,279
...and that's what makes them so good for
the body and good for the soul.

637
01:03:46,386 --> 01:03:47,975
They wouldn't help my mother, would they?

638
01:03:48,308 --> 01:03:49,462
Of course they would.

639
01:03:49,667 --> 01:03:53,669
My vegetable garden is bound to make
anyone feel better in no time at all.

640
01:03:53,795 --> 01:03:56,216
Our mother's coming home this week
from the hospital.

641
01:03:56,435 --> 01:03:58,847
And she's gonna come sleep with me
under my covers.

642
01:03:59,054 --> 01:04:00,144
That's wonderful.

643
01:04:00,522 --> 01:04:02,157
She's able to come back, is she?

644
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:06,593
Mm-mm, she's coming home to spend a couple of
days but then has to go right back there.

645
01:04:07,083 --> 01:04:08,714
I suppose she has to be careful.

646
01:04:08,956 --> 01:04:10,117
Yes, she has.

647
01:04:10,403 --> 01:04:13,017
But we'll fatten her up
on my fresh vegetables.

648
01:04:13,155 --> 01:04:16,208
I'm gonna give mommy this corn
I picked for her specially.

649
01:04:17,028 --> 01:04:19,137
And I'm sure she'll love you for it.

650
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:20,459
Mm-hmm.

651
01:04:28,174 --> 01:04:30,426
Mailman gave me this telegram
because you were out.

652
01:04:31,161 --> 01:04:31,764
Here.

653
01:04:35,634 --> 01:04:38,357
But daddy won't be home from
the university till after 9:00.

654
01:04:38,382 --> 01:04:39,546
Open it now then.

655
01:04:39,692 --> 01:04:41,630
A telegram is serious business.

656
01:04:41,781 --> 01:04:42,325
Mm-hmm.

657
01:04:45,364 --> 01:04:47,287
It's from my mother's doctor
at the hospital.

658
01:04:47,465 --> 01:04:48,701
<i>Please contact me.</i>

659
01:04:49,118 --> 01:04:51,904
What's that supposed to mean?
Is something wrong with her or not?

660
01:04:52,382 --> 01:04:54,046
I know something awful's
happened to her.

661
01:04:56,239 --> 01:04:58,483
What am I supposed to do
if my father's not home?

662
01:04:58,965 --> 01:05:00,356
Listen, you must be calm.

663
01:05:00,465 --> 01:05:02,457
Have you any way of
telephoning your father?

664
01:05:02,778 --> 01:05:06,091
I have the number of his research lab,
but we don't have a telephone to call him.

665
01:05:06,338 --> 01:05:09,750
Take them back to your mother's place,
and let them use the phone to reach their father.

666
01:05:09,890 --> 01:05:10,896
Do you understand?

667
01:05:11,382 --> 01:05:13,051
Don't panic, but go quickly.

668
01:05:13,450 --> 01:05:13,918
Mm-hmm.

669
01:05:15,759 --> 01:05:18,356
Mei, you make sure you stay put
at my house!

670
01:05:18,567 --> 01:05:20,630
Mei! Mei!

671
01:05:27,594 --> 01:05:31,379
Hey, Mei, don't follow me!
Go to Nanny's house.

672
01:05:38,996 --> 01:05:39,406
Oh.

673
01:06:07,125 --> 01:06:08,545
Hello, operator.

674
01:06:08,663 --> 01:06:10,638
I'd like to make a long-distance call,
please.

675
01:06:10,737 --> 01:06:14,202
It's very important.
It's number 1354 at station 12.

676
01:06:14,764 --> 01:06:15,244
Yes.

677
01:06:15,797 --> 01:06:17,012
Thank you very much.

678
01:06:17,134 --> 01:06:18,667
Your friend is very pretty.

679
01:06:19,051 --> 01:06:20,016
What lovely hair.

680
01:06:22,547 --> 01:06:23,047
Hello.

681
01:06:23,968 --> 01:06:24,558
Yes.

682
01:06:26,025 --> 01:06:28,980
Can you put me through to the main
lecture room of the anthropology school?

683
01:06:29,309 --> 01:06:31,152
To Professor Kusokabi.
Please hurry.

684
01:06:31,452 --> 01:06:33,167
Yes, yes. I'm his daughter.

685
01:06:37,705 --> 01:06:39,939
It was from the hospital, daddy!
I'm so worried!

686
01:06:39,964 --> 01:06:41,378
Whoa, whoa. Slow down.

687
01:06:42,357 --> 01:06:43,326
From the hospital?

688
01:06:44,042 --> 01:06:45,410
Oh, okay. It's all right.

689
01:06:45,982 --> 01:06:47,267
I think I understand.

690
01:06:47,436 --> 01:06:48,713
Now, I'm going to call the hospital.

691
01:06:48,738 --> 01:06:51,238
What's happened to mommy?
Tell me everything's gonna be all right!

692
01:06:51,353 --> 01:06:55,628
There's no need to worry. I'm going to check
with the hospital and call you right back, okay?

693
01:06:56,294 --> 01:06:57,259
- Okay?
- Uh-huh.

694
01:06:57,483 --> 01:06:59,001
- You stay where you are.
- Mm-hmm.

695
01:06:59,415 --> 01:07:01,466
I'm hanging up, so you stay right there.

696
01:07:03,464 --> 01:07:07,284
He'll be calling back, so is it all right if
I stay right here by the telephone and wait?

697
01:07:07,901 --> 01:07:10,348
You take all the time you need.

698
01:07:17,329 --> 01:07:19,252
Hey, where are you?

699
01:07:20,821 --> 01:07:21,916
Uh-oh.

700
01:07:28,222 --> 01:07:29,324
Oh, no!

701
01:07:29,515 --> 01:07:31,417
I'm gonna give this corn to my mommy!

702
01:07:33,056 --> 01:07:35,775
Go away!
You just better stop it right now!

703
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:55,937
Mei, the hospital said that mommy's
condition isn't very good...

704
01:07:56,113 --> 01:07:58,140
...so she isn't going to be
coming home just yet.

705
01:07:58,906 --> 01:08:00,208
But why?

706
01:08:01,184 --> 01:08:02,604
Mei, what can we do?

707
01:08:02,775 --> 01:08:05,174
If she came home now,
we'd only make it worse.

708
01:08:05,262 --> 01:08:06,420
It would not!

709
01:08:08,109 --> 01:08:10,341
But she'll be able
to come home real soon.

710
01:08:10,366 --> 01:08:11,811
No!

711
01:08:13,268 --> 01:08:15,780
All right then! Be that way!
Let's see if she dies!

712
01:08:15,805 --> 01:08:18,021
No!

713
01:08:18,046 --> 01:08:19,162
Don't be dumb, Mei!

714
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:21,578
Oh, I give up!
You're so stupid!

715
01:08:31,559 --> 01:08:32,344
Come on, Mei.

716
01:08:33,492 --> 01:08:36,148
Waah!

717
01:08:36,173 --> 01:08:38,509
I'm not stupid!

718
01:08:38,534 --> 01:08:40,481
Waah!

719
01:08:40,593 --> 01:08:41,968
Waah!

720
01:08:42,347 --> 01:08:44,956
Waa!

721
01:08:45,342 --> 01:08:46,608
Waah!

722
01:08:47,128 --> 01:08:47,714
Wah!

723
01:08:47,806 --> 01:08:49,548
Waah!

724
01:08:50,048 --> 01:08:51,134
Waa!

725
01:09:06,681 --> 01:09:09,094
I took care of the rest of the washing.

726
01:09:11,905 --> 01:09:13,144
Come on, now.

727
01:09:13,304 --> 01:09:15,091
It isn't the end of the world.

728
01:09:15,297 --> 01:09:17,185
Your old Nanny's here to help.

729
01:09:17,681 --> 01:09:19,581
Let's see that beautiful smile.

730
01:09:21,966 --> 01:09:25,430
Your father's going to be stopping off at
the hospital on his way home, eh?

731
01:09:26,115 --> 01:09:30,294
What I heard was that your mother
only caught a small cold, mm-hmm.

732
01:09:30,693 --> 01:09:32,737
She'll be home next weekend,
I believe.

733
01:09:33,173 --> 01:09:35,144
That's what they said last time, too.

734
01:09:37,675 --> 01:09:41,310
It'll be a little visit, just a few
days to see what's wrong with her.

735
01:09:41,893 --> 01:09:43,237
It's just a cold.

736
01:09:45,157 --> 01:09:47,286
What are me and Mei going to do
if mommy dies?

737
01:09:47,788 --> 01:09:49,045
Uh, uh...

738
01:09:49,884 --> 01:09:51,356
What are we going to do, Nanny?

739
01:09:56,705 --> 01:09:58,288
There, there.

740
01:10:01,303 --> 01:10:02,541
Don't worry.

741
01:10:02,679 --> 01:10:04,892
Your mother's not going to die.

742
01:10:05,139 --> 01:10:08,405
Hush. She'd never leave two
such beautiful children.

743
01:10:08,506 --> 01:10:10,921
She loves you too much for that.

744
01:10:11,245 --> 01:10:12,870
Don't cry.

745
01:10:13,058 --> 01:10:15,973
Nanny will stay with you
until your father comes home.

746
01:10:48,948 --> 01:10:50,311
Mei!

747
01:10:54,514 --> 01:10:56,307
Where are you?

748
01:11:01,625 --> 01:11:03,627
Mei!

749
01:11:06,122 --> 01:11:08,314
Mei, come back!

750
01:11:11,073 --> 01:11:13,213
- Did you see her anywhere?
- No sign at all.

751
01:11:13,557 --> 01:11:14,908
She wasn't at the bus stop?

752
01:11:16,634 --> 01:11:17,746
That's very strange.

753
01:11:18,010 --> 01:11:20,061
Where could she possibly have gone off to?

754
01:11:20,132 --> 01:11:23,362
Maybe she's angry about this morning.
We had a bad argument and--

755
01:11:24,141 --> 01:11:26,609
Maybe she went off to visit mommy
in the hospital!

756
01:11:27,013 --> 01:11:30,212
But the hospital's so far from here.
It's-- oh, my heavens!

757
01:11:30,581 --> 01:11:33,098
Why, it would take a grown man
three hours to get there.

758
01:11:35,046 --> 01:11:35,561
Hey!

759
01:11:36,768 --> 01:11:37,621
Oh, my goodness!

760
01:11:37,823 --> 01:11:39,751
Please, you must get your father right now.

761
01:11:40,022 --> 01:11:42,319
You must tell him that
little Mei has disappeared.

762
01:11:51,152 --> 01:11:54,693
How could you do something so stupid, Mei?
You always get lost.

763
01:12:02,373 --> 01:12:03,597
Mei!

764
01:12:11,262 --> 01:12:13,184
I'm sorry to bother you, but you--

765
01:12:13,653 --> 01:12:16,359
Well, you haven't seen a little girl
come by this way, have you?

766
01:12:16,984 --> 01:12:19,199
She's my sister, about 5 years old.

767
01:12:19,515 --> 01:12:21,736
Well, seems to me I remember someone.

768
01:12:22,548 --> 01:12:25,440
Eh, yes, near as I can recall,
she went that way.

769
01:12:25,730 --> 01:12:27,022
Maybe she went through the forest.

770
01:12:29,701 --> 01:12:31,979
And, then again, she might've gone
in the other direction.

771
01:12:32,111 --> 01:12:34,099
Uh, you're you sure it was your sister?

772
01:12:46,589 --> 01:12:49,023
All sorts of folks come by here,
but I don't see them.

773
01:12:49,302 --> 01:12:50,265
Mei, I'm scared.

774
01:12:51,006 --> 01:12:51,752
Thank you!

775
01:12:58,746 --> 01:13:01,367
Mei!

776
01:13:22,847 --> 01:13:26,058
- Please stop!
- Aah!

777
01:13:27,015 --> 01:13:29,500
- Hey, are you crazy, kid?
- I'm looking for my sister.

778
01:13:29,561 --> 01:13:31,524
Have you seen a little girl
wandering around?

779
01:13:32,344 --> 01:13:33,303
I'm afraid not.

780
01:13:33,510 --> 01:13:35,609
Mei is her name, and
she's about five years old.

781
01:13:35,755 --> 01:13:37,364
She probably got herself lost.

782
01:13:37,607 --> 01:13:39,067
We haven't seen anyone, have we?

783
01:13:39,314 --> 01:13:41,826
- I think she's going to Shechi Kokoyama.
- We just came from there...

784
01:13:41,851 --> 01:13:44,840
...but we haven't come across anybody for
the last couple of hours.

785
01:13:45,002 --> 01:13:45,971
I'm sorry.

786
01:13:46,047 --> 01:13:47,682
Well, um, thank you.

787
01:13:48,514 --> 01:13:49,986
By the way, where are you from?

788
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:51,586
Um, Matsuko.

789
01:13:51,611 --> 01:13:52,971
You walked from there to here?

790
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:55,438
- That's over three hours away!
- Yeah!

791
01:13:55,726 --> 01:13:57,160
Well, good luck, kid.

792
01:13:57,236 --> 01:13:58,648
I hope you find her!

793
01:14:09,136 --> 01:14:10,330
Satsuki, wait!

794
01:14:10,684 --> 01:14:11,437
Come here!

795
01:14:12,309 --> 01:14:13,357
Kanta!

796
01:14:15,841 --> 01:14:17,659
We haven't found her yet.
How about you?

797
01:14:18,067 --> 01:14:18,756
Nothing.

798
01:14:18,996 --> 01:14:21,119
Hey, my dad's got everyone
in the village searching for her...

799
01:14:21,190 --> 01:14:23,979
...so you go home, and I'll bike
to Shechi Kokoyama, okay?

800
01:14:24,505 --> 01:14:24,966
Okay?

801
01:14:25,062 --> 01:14:28,186
But I'm afraid if she goes to visit mommy's hospital,
she'll completely lose her--

802
01:14:28,248 --> 01:14:28,910
Wait a second!

803
01:14:29,492 --> 01:14:32,258
Somebody found some sandals
by the lake, half an hour ago.

804
01:14:33,471 --> 01:14:36,871
There's no way she could get past
all those people without somebody noticing.

805
01:14:37,471 --> 01:14:38,169
Oh!

806
01:14:39,636 --> 01:14:42,596
Hey, don't worry!
Nobody said they were Mei's sandals!

807
01:14:59,889 --> 01:15:00,934
Did you find her yet?

808
01:15:37,178 --> 01:15:39,922
Go back a bit over towards your right,
we haven't covered that area!

809
01:15:40,110 --> 01:15:41,753
Hey, you have any poles left?

810
01:15:51,460 --> 01:15:52,435
There's Satsuki.

811
01:15:52,977 --> 01:15:53,640
Eh?

812
01:15:54,171 --> 01:15:54,672
Look.

813
01:15:57,516 --> 01:15:58,843
Mei! Mei!

814
01:16:00,289 --> 01:16:01,774
Look, Satsuki.

815
01:16:02,593 --> 01:16:04,328
Is it hers?

816
01:16:11,230 --> 01:16:12,592
It's not hers.

817
01:16:12,884 --> 01:16:13,401
Wha?

818
01:16:19,567 --> 01:16:21,211
Ohh...

819
01:16:23,017 --> 01:16:24,506
Merciful heavens.

820
01:16:25,499 --> 01:16:28,806
You know, Satsuki,
for a while I thought it might be Mei's.

821
01:16:28,875 --> 01:16:30,490
Mom, I told you, you jump to
conclusions too fast.

822
01:16:30,515 --> 01:16:33,527
Hey, boys! Forget it! Stop!
It isn't hers!

823
01:16:33,618 --> 01:16:34,871
So, what do we do now?

824
01:16:34,971 --> 01:16:36,904
Well, we keep on looking, that's what.

825
01:16:37,201 --> 01:16:40,719
Well, whatever you do, you better hurry up.
It's going to be dark soon.

826
01:16:40,860 --> 01:16:43,423
I'm grateful to you all.
I know it's tough work...

827
01:16:43,516 --> 01:16:46,585
- ...but if you could keep searching--
- Aw, don't worry. We understand.

828
01:16:46,726 --> 01:16:49,197
Hey, don't you think we
should call the police?

829
01:16:50,029 --> 01:16:52,640
Well, I don't know.
Do you think the police could--

830
01:16:53,505 --> 01:16:54,905
Please, where are you going?

831
01:17:12,642 --> 01:17:13,422
Totoro...

832
01:17:14,233 --> 01:17:17,569
I beg you, please protect Mei.
She'll be lost and probably scared.

833
01:17:17,860 --> 01:17:21,567
Please believe me, I'll be good for
the rest of my life if I can just see her again.

834
01:17:51,006 --> 01:17:51,810
What?

835
01:17:52,586 --> 01:17:53,406
Totoro!

836
01:17:55,661 --> 01:17:57,357
Totoro, ‭Mei's lost somewhere!

837
01:17:57,435 --> 01:17:59,648
I looked and looked, but
I can't find her anywhere!

838
01:18:00,020 --> 01:18:02,390
Oh, please, you have to help me find her.

839
01:18:02,868 --> 01:18:05,907
She's probably alone somewhere,
crying and upset.

840
01:18:06,749 --> 01:18:08,842
Oh, Totoro, I'm scared.

841
01:18:54,505 --> 01:18:55,370
What?

842
01:19:05,455 --> 01:19:06,617
He wouldn't be able to.

843
01:19:08,131 --> 01:19:10,081
But how come nobody sees the bus?

844
01:19:39,740 --> 01:19:40,556
Oh...

845
01:19:43,390 --> 01:19:43,796
Oh!

846
01:20:01,986 --> 01:20:03,713
Next stop, little sister.

847
01:20:21,768 --> 01:20:24,650
Mei, where are you?

848
01:20:33,341 --> 01:20:34,986
But how does he make it do that?

849
01:21:04,952 --> 01:21:05,405
Ohh...

850
01:21:07,253 --> 01:21:08,994
Mei!

851
01:21:12,201 --> 01:21:14,003
But, sis, where are you?

852
01:21:15,876 --> 01:21:18,899
- Satsuki!
- Mei!

853
01:21:28,873 --> 01:21:30,120
There you are!

854
01:21:30,227 --> 01:21:31,539
Satsuki!

855
01:21:34,950 --> 01:21:35,956
Oh, Mei.

856
01:21:36,069 --> 01:21:37,997
I'm sorry.

857
01:21:40,188 --> 01:21:42,960
Tell me one thing:
were you bringing that corn to the hospital?

858
01:21:43,256 --> 01:21:44,220
Mm-hmm.

859
01:21:49,973 --> 01:21:52,819
Next stop, Shechi Kokoyama Hospital.

860
01:21:55,579 --> 01:21:57,299
You mean we can go to mom's hospital?

861
01:21:59,985 --> 01:22:01,368
You're wonderful!

862
01:22:10,411 --> 01:22:11,444
I'm sorry.

863
01:22:11,849 --> 01:22:15,101
It was all because of my silly cold
that the hospital sent you that telegram.

864
01:22:15,665 --> 01:22:17,906
The grief it must've caused all of you.

865
01:22:18,574 --> 01:22:20,038
I hope you can forgive me.

866
01:22:20,342 --> 01:22:22,601
It was simply a bureaucratic mistake.

867
01:22:22,860 --> 01:22:25,946
I'm sure it wasn't terribly traumatic
for either of the girls.

868
01:22:26,190 --> 01:22:28,232
It just means you'll be home next weekend.

869
01:22:28,614 --> 01:22:29,540
They understand.

870
01:22:29,927 --> 01:22:32,973
I wouldn't be at all surprised
if they suffered more than we know...

871
01:22:33,376 --> 01:22:36,488
...in particular Satsuki, because
she's so smart and sensitive.

872
01:22:36,747 --> 01:22:38,431
Hmm, could be right.

873
01:22:39,294 --> 01:22:41,572
You'd better be careful
after I get home because...

874
01:22:41,681 --> 01:22:43,725
...I intend to spoil them rotten
for a while!

875
01:22:43,831 --> 01:22:44,689
Oh, no!

876
01:22:52,156 --> 01:22:53,651
Look. Mommy's laughing.

877
01:22:53,961 --> 01:22:55,880
- She seems pretty healthy to me.
- Yep!

878
01:23:04,033 --> 01:23:06,332
Oh, I can't wait to get up
on my feet again.

879
01:23:06,427 --> 01:23:07,331
Neither can we.

880
01:23:08,693 --> 01:23:09,461
Oh.

881
01:23:12,719 --> 01:23:13,249
Hmm.

882
01:23:16,256 --> 01:23:17,218
Now, that's weird.

883
01:23:18,033 --> 01:23:18,590
Oh!

884
01:23:19,798 --> 01:23:20,482
What happened?

885
01:23:21,499 --> 01:23:25,932
Well, I'm not sure, but I could've sworn that
I saw both the girls up in the treetop laughing.

886
01:23:27,625 --> 01:23:30,301
That might not be as crazy as you think...
have a look!

887
01:23:30,430 --> 01:23:32,481
<i>For mother.</i>

888
01:23:36,253 --> 01:23:38,920
 Totoro
Totoro 

889
01:23:39,975 --> 01:23:42,424
 Totoro
Totoro 

890
01:23:51,585 --> 01:23:54,373
 Who leaves the seeds 

891
01:23:55,321 --> 01:23:57,878
 For you to find? 

892
01:23:58,576 --> 01:23:59,771
 Follow them 

893
01:23:59,843 --> 01:24:01,489
 And you will see 

894
01:24:01,568 --> 01:24:04,373
 A treasure there 

895
01:24:06,487 --> 01:24:09,033
 Then plant the seeds 

896
01:24:10,201 --> 01:24:12,991
 And help them grow 

897
01:24:13,476 --> 01:24:16,482
 It may seem like a dream 

898
01:24:16,854 --> 01:24:20,234
 But things are not what they seem 

899
01:24:20,934 --> 01:24:23,882
 Now begins a new adventure 

900
01:24:23,907 --> 01:24:26,697
 For you 

901
01:24:27,470 --> 01:24:30,903
 And you'll be with Totoro
Totoro 

902
01:24:32,066 --> 01:24:34,848
 Totoro
Totoro 

903
01:24:36,247 --> 01:24:39,246
 Living in the forest trees 

904
01:24:39,271 --> 01:24:42,012
 For such a very, very long time 

905
01:24:42,318 --> 01:24:44,326
 There you'll be with Totoro 

906
01:24:44,425 --> 01:24:45,810
 Totoro 

907
01:24:46,958 --> 01:24:49,811
 Totoro
Totoro 

908
01:24:50,485 --> 01:24:54,137
 You only see him
When you're very young 

909
01:24:54,207 --> 01:24:58,035
 A magical adventure for you 

910
01:24:58,793 --> 01:25:02,295
 It's magic for you 

911
01:25:04,195 --> 01:25:07,768
 Rain tumbles down 

912
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:10,656
 The bus is late 

913
01:25:11,117 --> 01:25:12,507
 Suddenly 

914
01:25:12,532 --> 01:25:14,199
 A furry wet giant 

915
01:25:14,224 --> 01:25:17,411
 Is by your side 

916
01:25:19,069 --> 01:25:21,404
 Don't be afraid 

917
01:25:22,758 --> 01:25:25,558
 Just open wide 

918
01:25:26,045 --> 01:25:29,301
 Your umbrella for him 

919
01:25:29,671 --> 01:25:33,074
 Watch him play in the rain 

920
01:25:33,474 --> 01:25:36,733
 Now begins a new adventure 

921
01:25:36,758 --> 01:25:39,528
 For you 

922
01:25:40,019 --> 01:25:42,019
 And you'll be with Totoro 

923
01:25:42,127 --> 01:25:43,864
 Totoro 

924
01:25:44,653 --> 01:25:47,439
 Totoro
Totoro 

925
01:25:48,857 --> 01:25:51,765
 And on a moonlit night 

926
01:25:51,867 --> 01:25:54,640
 He plays a magic flute in the sky 

927
01:25:54,891 --> 01:25:56,876
 There you'll be with Totoro 

928
01:25:57,010 --> 01:25:58,551
 Totoro 

929
01:25:59,532 --> 01:26:02,303
 Totoro
Totoro 

930
01:26:03,026 --> 01:26:04,605
 You only see him 

931
01:26:04,630 --> 01:26:06,489
 When you're very young 

932
01:26:06,798 --> 01:26:10,909
 A magical adventure for you 

933
01:26:11,411 --> 01:26:16,427
 It's magic for you
